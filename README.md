Note to readers: On December 1, 2020, the Libra Association was renamed to Diem Association. The project repos are in the process of being migrated. All projects will remain available for use here until the migration to a new GitHub Organization is complete.

Diem Improvement Proposals (DIP) describe standards for the Diem Payment Network (DPN) including the core blockchain protocol and the development platform (Move), smart contracts and systems for smart contract verification, standards for the deployment and operation of the DPN, APIs for accessing the DPN and processing information from the DPN, and off-chain mechanisms.

To submit or modify a DIP please refer to the instructions outlined on [dip.diem.com](https://dip.diem.com).
